      <h2 class="page-title">WHO WE ARE</h2>
      <p>We are Delta Global Staffing (DGS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, delivering integrity, innovation and an elevated degree of responsiveness to customers throughout the United States.</p>
      <p>Through forward thinking, our parent company created DGS to source, screen and manage a first class contingent workforce for the airline.</p>
      <p>Our successes have taken DGS nationally with a diverse customer base, a robust menu of creative solutions and services that encompass nearly every industry and profession.</p>
      <h3>WHAT'S IN A NAME</h3>
      <p>In a world of staffing firms, brand recognition is everything. It's one of the most efficient forms of marketing. As a DGS client, the Delta brand delivers top talent and the ideal fit for our clients.</p>
      <h3>THE DGS RELATIONSHIP</h3>
      <p>Since 1995, DGS has grown by cultivating collaborative relationships built on dialog, targeted talent acquisition and results based on accountability. We don't just fill orders for our clients; we speak their language and solve their problems.</p>
      <h3>THE DGS DIFFERENCE</h3>
      <p>DGS has a distinct recruiting and retention advantage in every market we serve. How? Delta Global Staffing is the only firm that offers active employee Flight Benefits for the employee and family on Delta Air Lines. If you could fly practically free, would you work anywhere else?</h3>
      <h3>ROCK SOLID STABILITY</h3> 
      <p>Turnover is disruptive, unproductive and quite costly for any business. Our unique benefits package all but eliminates turnover by promoting loyalty in our employees. The end result is a dedicated and productive contingent workforce that delivers cost efficient solutions for our customers.</p>
      <p>In recognition of this stability, DGS is honored to award employees with service anniversary pins for 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years and now, 15 years of loyal service. We are immensely proud of this accomplishment.</p>
